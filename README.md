README.md
Nigeria’s Digital Postal Infrastructure is at a crossroads: while NIPOST is modernizing its services, there is little public evidence of deployed AI-driven geolocation systems or of explainability-by-design measures within national postal geolocation operations. Globally, postal and logistics actors are accelerating the use of AI for sorting, tracking and last-mile optimisation, and the Universal Postal Union has recently prototyped an AI agent to analyse postal development data — signalling that AI adoption across national postal networks is likely to increase. At the same time, academic and technical research in geospatial explainable AI (GeoXAI) shows both practical methods (e.g., SHAP visualizations on maps, map-based explanation interfaces) and technical challenges unique to geographic data (scale, topology, locality). If Nigeria adopts AI for postal geolocation without an explainability framework, decisions about address matching, routing, delay prediction and service prioritization risk being opaque to citizens, operators and regulators — potentially eroding trust, complicating oversight, and producing unintended socio-spatial biases. This study therefore investigates how Explainable AI (XAI) can be proactively integrated into Nigeria’s postal geolocation stack by synthesizing global lessons, proposing an XAI governance+technical framework, and building a GeoXAI prototype to demonstrate measurable benefits for transparency and adoption.

Specific objectives (each one paragraph)

Objective 1 — Landscape & comparative lessons (literature + case studies):
Conduct a systematic literature and case-study review mapping current AI uses in postal and last-mile logistics, and the state of GeoXAI research and prototypes. This objective will (a) document UPU and international postal initiatives and public-sector pilots, (b) compile private-sector last-mile AI practices relevant to postal geolocation, and (c) synthesise academic GeoXAI methods and documented challenges (e.g., SHAP visualizations, GeoXAI prototypes, geosocial issues). Deliverable: a 20–30 page comparative report that identifies technical, governance and user-facing lessons for NIPOST and highlights gaps where explainability is missing.

Objective 2 — Design an explainability-by-design framework for NIPOST geolocation services:
Develop a practical XAI framework tailored for postal geolocation functions (address parsing/matching, geocoding, routing/ETA prediction, parcel-risk scoring) that specifies (i) model families and when to prefer interpretable models vs black-box + XAI post-hoc methods, (ii) concrete explanation techniques (local vs global explanations, SHAP/ICE, map-based visualizations), (iii) data governance and provenance controls, and (iv) stakeholder interfaces and regulatory alignment (how to present explanations to citizens, operators, and regulators). Deliverable: an actionable framework document with decision matrices and example explanation UI wireframes. This objective builds on GeoXAI methods and XAI policy guidance.

Objective 3 — Prototype GeoXAI proof-of-concept and user evaluation:
Implement a lightweight GeoXAI prototype (suggested pilot: address-matching + geocoding or route-ETA prediction) using open/available spatial data and XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP mapped overlays, explanation logs). Run a mixed-method evaluation with NIPOST staff and a sample of end-users to measure (a) interpretability/explanation satisfaction, (b) changes in trust and willingness to accept automated decisions, and (c) operational metrics (accuracy, ETA variance). Deliverables: working code repository, interactive explanation demo, user study report (quant + qual) with recommended thresholds for adoption. This objective is informed by GeoXAI prototypes and last-mile XAI applications in logistics research.
